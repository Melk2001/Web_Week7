        <p> Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preperation of cocao seeds
            roasted and ground and often flavoured with vanilla. It is made in the form of
            a liquid, paste, or in a block,or used as a flavouring ingredient in other foods
            . Cocao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millenia in Mesoamerica.
            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the  typesetting industy. 
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since 
            the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a gallery of type and scrambled 
            it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only centuries, but 
            also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
            It was popularised  in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
            containing Lorem Ipsum passages,and more recently with desktop publishing 
            software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem  Ipsum.
